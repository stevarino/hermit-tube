# HermitTube

[hermit.tube](https://hermit.tube) - This is a way to watch all of the
[HermitCraft](http://hermitcraft.com) seasons and follow your favorite
hermits in order!

See [CubedTube](https://github.com/stevarino/cubed-tube) for technical
details or to set up additional sites.

## Motivation

The first reason I created this site was I wanted to easily watch a
HermitCraft season in order while bouncing between series.

The second was I wanted to build a low-dependency, simple, and
understandable web app. The web has become a lot more complicated over
the last few years, but it doesn't have to be. I hope this site helps
others learn the craft and passion that I picked up many years ago.

If you find this site helpful or have any questions, I would love to 
hear from you.
